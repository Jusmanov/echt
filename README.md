# echt
Echt is a platform focused on documentation on user data protection and user privacy. It's intended to help developers further their knowledge of data protection in a digital world filled with numerous vulnerabilities in user data. Not only does Echt have documentation, but it contains the latest news and upcoming events regarding consumer privacy/data.

## Creation
Echt was created with HTML and CSS, although there was a small portion of JavaScript written for this project. I focused on a purely frontend design because backend work seems unnecessary when taking my purpose with this project into account. Lots of research regarding data protection was done for this project but LLMs were also used for information.

## Test it Out
Unlike my other projects, I am hosting this on Vercel.
